# LESSFormer-hyperspectral-image-classification
Demo code of "LESSFormer: Local-Enhanced Spectral-Spatial Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification"

## Step 1: prepare dataset
Xiongâ€™an (1580 Ã— 3750 pixels): http://www.hrs-cas.com/a/share/shujuchanpin/2019/0501/1049.html
Clipped Xiongâ€™an (800 Ã— 1000 pixels, Xiongâ€™an[300:1100,1500:2500,:]): 
I will also organize the processing codes so that you can obtain your own experiment areas. ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡
